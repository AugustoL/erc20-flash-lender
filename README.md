# ERC20 Flash Lender

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER: This is a personal/educational project that has NOT been professionally audited. Do NOT use with real funds on mainnet without a comprehensive security audit.**

A flash loan protocol for ERC20 tokens with proportional fee sharing among liquidity providers. Built using OpenZeppelin's battle-tested contracts with comprehensive precision attack protections and reviewed by AI systems, but requires professional audit before production use.

## Features

- 🚀 **Flash Loans**: Instant, uncollateralized loans for MEV operations
- 🎯 **Multi-Token Flash Loans**: Borrow multiple tokens simultaneously in a single transaction
- 💰 **Fee Sharing**: Proportional fee distribution among liquidity providers
- 🆕 **Fee Harvesting**: Withdraw earned fees while keeping principal staked for compound growth
- 🗳️ **Democratic Governance**: LPs vote on fee rates with share-weighted voting
- ⏰ **Delayed Execution**: 10-block delay for governance decisions
- 🛡️ **Security First**: Comprehensive protection against precision attacks and common DeFi exploits
- ⚡ **Ultra-Low Fees**: Default 0.01% LP fee with 1% of it as management fee (as % of LP fee)
- 🔧 **Upgradeable**: Built with OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts
- 📊 **Share-Based**: Fair fee distribution using share-based accounting with virtual shares protection
- 🔄 **Advanced Executors**: Gas-optimized executor contracts for complex multi-step operations

## Return on Investment (ROI)

Potential APY ranges from 1-10% (conservative) to 50-200%+ (high utilization) depending on flash loan adoption and fee governance.

- ✅ **Fixed Entry/Exit Fees**: 100 wei fixed fees (not percentage-based) that accumulate as permanent dust
- ✅ **Minimum Withdrawal**: Rejects withdrawals below minimum threshold after exit fees
- ✅ **Precision Loss Prevention**: Direct fee calculation without nested division to prevent rounding manipulation

### Standard DeFi Protections
- ✅ Reentrancy protection
- ✅ Share dilution attack prevention  
- ✅ Arithmetic underflow/overflow protection

### Development Environment Setup

The project provides three development scripts for different workflows:

#### Option 1: Full Development Environment (Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev
```
Runs the complete development stack - compiles contracts, starts Hardhat node, deploys contracts, and launches the React app.

#### Option 2: App Development Only
```bash
npm run dev:app
```
Starts only the React development server. Use this when developing frontend features with the GitHub Pages deployed contracts.

#### Option 3: Local Node Only
```bash
npm run dev:node
```
Starts only the Hardhat node with deployed contracts. Use this to connect the GitHub Pages app to your local blockchain for testing.

The full development script (`npm run dev`) will:

- 🏦 Deploy the ERC20FlashLender contract
- 🪙 Deploy 4 test tokens (TUSDC, TDAI, TWETH, TWBTC) with different decimals
- 👥 Set up 4 test accounts with token balances
- 💰 Make initial deposits to get the pools started
- 📄 Save deployment info to `deployment-dev.json`
- 🔧 Provide ready-to-use contract interaction snippets

**Test Tokens Deployed:**
- TUSDC (6 decimals): Test USDC - 1B supply
- TDAI (18 decimals): Test DAI - 1B supply  
- TWETH (18 decimals): Test WETH - 100K supply
- TWBTC (8 decimals): Test WBTC - 21K supply

**Test Accounts Setup:**
- Deployer: Contract owner with all permissions
- User1, User2, User3: Each gets 10K of every test token

This setup provides a complete local testing environment with realistic token scenarios and pre-funded accounts for immediate testing of flash loans, deposits, withdrawals, and governance features.

## React DApp Frontend

**For full local development:**
```bash
npm run dev  # All-in-one: compile, deploy, and start app
```

**For frontend-only development:**
```bash
npm run dev:app  # Uses GitHub Pages deployed contracts
```

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Audit Status

**THIS CONTRACT HAS NOT BEEN PROFESSIONALLY AUDITED**

- ❌ **No professional security audit performed**
- ✅ **AI-assisted code review completed**
- ✅ **Built on OpenZeppelin's audited contracts**
- ✅ **Comprehensive test suite (75+ passing tests)**
- ✅ **Security best practices implemented**
- ✅ **Precision attack protections implemented**

**DO NOT USE WITH REAL FUNDS ON MAINNET WITHOUT A PROFESSIONAL AUDIT**

### Risk Factors

- **Unaudited code risk** - Primary concern
- Smart contract risk
- Admin key risk (limited to management fees only)  
- Liquidity risk
- Governance manipulation risk (voting power concentration)
- Time delay risks (governance proposals can be front-run)
- Oracle dependencies (if added)

### Precision Attack Mitigations

This protocol implements comprehensive protections against precision-based attacks:

1. **Virtual Shares (1000)**: Automatically minted to owner on first deposit
   - Dilutes small attackers' ability to manipulate share calculations
   - Makes it impossible to achieve meaningful ownership with dust amounts

2. **Minimum Deposit (100M wei)**: Enforced on all deposits
   - Makes dust attacks economically unviable
   - Ensures meaningful stake for all participants

3. **Fixed Entry/Exit Fees (100 wei each)**: 
   - Not percentage-based, creates permanent dust accumulation
   - Reduces profitability of repeated small operations
   - Acts as economic deterrent for precision attacks

4. **Minimum Withdrawal Validation**:
   - Rejects withdrawals below minimum threshold after exit fees
   - Prevents dust withdrawals that could be used for manipulation

5. **Precision-Safe Fee Calculations**:
   - Direct multiplication instead of nested division
   - Prevents rounding manipulation in fee calculations

These protections work together to make precision attacks both technically difficult and economically unviable.

### Best Practices

- Use multisig for owner account
- Implement time locks for admin functions
- Monitor for unusual activity
- Keep emergency procedures ready

## Gas Optimization

- Efficient share-based accounting
- Minimal storage operations
- Optimized compiler settings
- Gas reporter integration
