# ERC20 Flash Lender

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER: This is a personal/educational project that has NOT been professionally audited. Do NOT use with real funds on mainnet without a comprehensive security audit.**

A flash loan protocol for ERC20 tokens with proportional fee sharing among liquidity providers. Built using OpenZeppelin's battle-tested contracts and reviewed by AI systems, but requires professional audit before production use.

## Features

- 🚀 **Flash Loans**: Instant, uncollateralized loans for MEV operations
- 💰 **Fee Sharing**: Proportional fee distribution among liquidity providers
- 🗳️ **Democratic Governance**: LPs vote on fee rates with share-weighted voting
- ⏰ **Delayed Execution**: 10-block delay for governance decisions
- 🛡️ **Security First**: Comprehensive protection against common DeFi attacks
- ⚡ **Ultra-Low Fees**: Default 0.01% LP fee with 1% of it as management fee (as % of LP fee)
- 🔧 **Upgradeable**: Built with OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts
- 📊 **Share-Based**: Fair fee distribution using share-based accounting

## Security Features

- ✅ Reentrancy protection
- ✅ Share dilution attack prevention  
- ✅ Arithmetic underflow/overflow protection
- ✅ Interface compliance checking
- ✅ Minimum deposit requirements
- ✅ Fee caps and validation
- ✅ Share-weighted governance voting
- ✅ Time-delayed execution system
- ✅ Proposal validation and cleanup

## Contract Overview

### Core Functions

- `deposit(token, amount)` - Deposit tokens to earn fees
- `withdraw(token)` - Withdraw principal + accumulated fees  
- `flashLoan(token, amount, receiver, data)` - Execute flash loan

### Admin Functions

- `setManagementFee(percentage)` - Set management fee as % of LP fee (1-5%)
- `withdrawManagementFees(token)` - Withdraw collected fees

### LP Governance Functions

- `voteForLPFee(token, feeAmountBps)` - Vote for LP fee amount (share-weighted)
- `proposeLPFeeChange(token, newFeeBps)` - Propose fee change based on governance
- `executeLPFeeChange(token, newFeeBps)` - Execute approved fee change after delay

### View Functions

- `getWithdrawableAmount(token, user)` - Preview withdrawal amount
- `getEffectiveLPFee(token)` - Get current LP fee rate

## Fee Structure

| Fee Type | Default Rate | Range | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| LP Fee | 0.01% (1 bps) | 0-1% (0-100 bps) | Goes to liquidity providers (set by LP governance) |
| Management Fee | 1% of LP fee | 1-5% of LP fee | Percentage of LP fee that goes to protocol owner (admin controlled) |

### Fee Calculation Example
For a 1000 token flash loan with LP fee = 50 bps (0.5%) and management fee = 200 (2%):
- LP Fee: 5 tokens (0.5% of loan)
- Management Fee: 0.1 tokens (2% of LP fee = 2% × 5 = 0.1)  
- **Total Fee**: 5.1 tokens (0.51% of loan)
- **Total Repayment**: 1005.1 tokens

## Usage Examples

### For Liquidity Providers

```solidity
// Approve tokens
IERC20(token).approve(lender, amount);

// Deposit to earn fees
lender.deposit(token, amount);

// Vote on LP fee (share-weighted governance)
lender.voteForLPFee(token, 25); // Vote for 0.25% fee

// Propose fee change if you have enough support
lender.proposeLPFeeChange(token, 25); // Propose 0.25% fee

// Execute fee change after 10-block delay
lender.executeLPFeeChange(token, 25); // Execute approved change

// Check earnings
(uint256 total, uint256 principal, uint256 fees) = 
    lender.getWithdrawableAmount(token, msg.sender);

// Withdraw everything
lender.withdraw(token);
```

### For Flash Loan Borrowers

```solidity
contract MyFlashLoanReceiver is IFlashLoanReceiver {
    function executeOperation(
        address token,
        uint256 amount, 
        uint256 totalOwed,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external override returns (bool) {
        // Your arbitrage/liquidation logic here
        
        // Ensure you have enough tokens to repay
        IERC20(token).approve(msg.sender, totalOwed);
        return true;
    }
}

// Execute flash loan
bytes memory data = abi.encode(someParams);
lender.flashLoan(token, amount, receiver, data);
```

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Audit Status

**THIS CONTRACT HAS NOT BEEN PROFESSIONALLY AUDITED**

- ❌ **No professional security audit performed**
- ✅ **AI-assisted code review completed**
- ✅ **Built on OpenZeppelin's audited contracts**
- ✅ **Comprehensive test suite (46 passing tests)**
- ✅ **Security best practices implemented**

**DO NOT USE WITH REAL FUNDS ON MAINNET WITHOUT A PROFESSIONAL AUDIT**

### Risk Factors

- **Unaudited code risk** - Primary concern
- Smart contract risk
- Admin key risk (limited to management fees only)  
- Liquidity risk
- Governance manipulation risk (voting power concentration)
- Time delay risks (governance proposals can be front-run)
- Oracle dependencies (if added)

### Best Practices

- Use multisig for owner account
- Implement time locks for admin functions
- Monitor for unusual activity
- Keep emergency procedures ready

## Gas Optimization

- Efficient share-based accounting
- Minimal storage operations
- Optimized compiler settings
- Gas reporter integration
