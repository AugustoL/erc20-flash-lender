# Personal Notes

The idea of this personal note is to record my experience from having an idea and using AI to make an MVP from it. I used Claude 4.0 & 4.1 (with Anthropic subscription) and the free OpenAI ChatGPT 4.0.

The project started after brainstorming with ChatGPT about flash loans and how to make a fun project with it. Thus, the idea of a platform where you can easily deposit any ERC20 token to be used for flash loans.

The first version was submitted to GitHub after a day of work, with tests and documentation, looking pretty solid. BUT I have to recognize that I had to intervene multiple times and fix bugs that the AI agents weren't picking up. Nevertheless, I am amazed by how much I was able to advance. I think reaching this amount of code with this quality would have taken me 2-3 weeks in the past, and I was able to do this in just one day.
I'm feeling pretty confident about the code quality, but now I will do a more intense personal review, plus audits by AI agents, using deep research options to focus more on finding vulnerabilities and code optimizations.
